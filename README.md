Iris Flower Classification

  This project builds a classification model to identify the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. The classic Iris dataset includes three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project uses supervised learning to train a model using machine learning techniques.


  Uses the popular Iris dataset from UCI

  Explores feature distribution and correlations

  Applies standard preprocessing and scaling

  Trains classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, etc.)

  Evaluates accuracy, precision, confusion matrix

  Visualizes decision boundaries and metrics
